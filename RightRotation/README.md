## Right Rotation Algorithm

### Implementation Details:

- Store the Last Element: The last element of the array is temporarily stored because it will be moved to the first position.
- Shift Elements Right: Starting from the second-to-last element, each element is moved one position to the right.
- Place Last Element at the Start: The stored last element is placed in the first position.
